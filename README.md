# BO4E-Java-Generator

This repository contains the code and workflow used to generate java classes for the objects of the BO4E standard.
They are published automatically to the [BO4E-Java](https://github.com/TimoMolls/BO4E-Java) repository.
The generator uses the schemas from the [BO4E-Schemas](https://github.com/bo4e/BO4E-Schemas) repository.
